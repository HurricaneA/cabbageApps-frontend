# Overview of my task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

Things to Note

- Make sure to change the baseurl in redux/action-creators/index.ts file
- No testing was done as this is my first project ever on typescript and it took a while to code the frontend.
- Added a bit of stories in typescript.
- The project was not done within 3-5 hours and I did it while learning typescript + typescript redux.
